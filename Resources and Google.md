# Resource Guide and How to Google
This guide offers several resources and strategies for students to utilize in the event that they are finding difficulties during the assignments. It is expected that students have attempted at least some variation of these strategies before asking for instructor or resident assistance.

# Before Searching the Internet

1. **Review the Lecture Material If You Have Trouble Understanding the Question**
    * If you are struggling to understand the question, it may be in your best interest to look back at the lecture/reading material to get a better understanding of the topic at hand.

2. **Re-read the Question and/or Assignment to Make Sure You Haven't Omitted Any Important Details**
    * Check the assignment again to see if you missed any important tips or instructions such as specific code to run or how to install certain packages.
    * Read ahead in the assignment. Progression in the assignments often involve building upon the previous question. Looking ahead can point you in the right direction.

3. **Check Your Code for Mistakes**
    * If your code is producing an error, make sure you understand what the error message is indicating. Check which line is producing the error, what type of error it is, and edit the code accordingly.
    For example, if you get this:
        ~~~
        TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a number, not 'Bunch'
        ~~~~
        Look into your code where there should be a float and try to find out where you may have put in a Bunch. If you don't know what a Bunch is, Google it!
    
    * Make sure that your syntax is correct. Ensure that everything is spelled correctly and that all brackets, parentheses, etc. are closed.

4. **Discuss with Your Pair/Fellow Peers On How They Approached the Problem**
    * Your classmates should be the first people you reach out to before asking for help from staff. Our goal is that you eventually become autonomous from instructor assistance and your peers are a good avenue to problem-solve together.

# How to Search for External Help
If you are still struggling after attempting the above, there are several resources you can use through Google.

## Google is Your Best Friend
When stuck, use Google! A valuable skill you will need is to quickly and efficiently search Google for fixes to your problems/useful tools that will help you.

### Useful Websites:
1. **Stack Overflow**
2. Github
3. GeeksforGeeks
4. **Documentation**
    * Examples:
        * (**Pandas**) pandas.pydata.org
        * (**SKLearn**) scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html

These are just a few of many helpful websites that can help you solve your problems.

### What to Put in Your Search
1. Don't know the correct parameters for a function or model? Look the function or model up! (Documentation will be very helpful in these cases)
    * For example, scikit-learn.org offers examples of its models and gives an explanation for all of the relevant parameters.

2. Did your code produce an error? Chances are several people have experienced the same thing before.

    If there is an error in your code, it will output a message at the bottom that attempts to explain the type of error and issue causing said error. For example:
    ~~~
    TypeError: no supported conversion for types: (dtype('float64'), dtype('O'))
    ~~~
    Try inputting the error into Google. You may immediately find results pertaining to that error. Stack Overflow is a good resources in this case.

## If You Are Still Stuck
Now is the time to ask your instructors or residents to help. It should be your goal to eventually become autonomous from staff assistance and be able to problem-solve independently.


# General Problem-Solving Workflow
**Before Googling**
1. **Review** lectures and readings if you are struggling to understand the material.
2. **Re-read** the assignment and question to make sure you have not omitted any critical steps and are interpreting the prompt correctly.
3. **Check** your code for mistakes. If your code is not running properly, check that it is not due to mistakes in syntax, spelling, etc.
4. **Discuss** with your peers. They should be the first you contact if you are in need of help.

**When Searching Online**

5. **Enhance** your search query by using key phrases such as:
    * Some context to your issue
    * Error codes
6. **Refine** your search to reputable websites and resources.

**And If You Still Need Help**

7. **Ask** an instructor or resident for help. They will check that you made some effort to solve the problem yourself first, then assist you.
